# gltfModels
just some gltf models I made

I build most of my models with babylonjs or blocks

 - To convert blocks to glb
 - C:\Users\ __YOUR NAME__ \Documents\Blocks\Models\rtfqyi
 - Select obj and mtl file and drag them to https://www.khronos.org/news/permalink/new-drag-and-drop-to-convert-obj-models-to-gltf
 - now u got glb :)
